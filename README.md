SyntaxHighlighter Evolved: Yaml Brush
=====================================

This Wordpress Plugin adds support for the Yaml language to the [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) plugin using the Brush created by [Nicolas Perriault](http://prendreuncafe.com/blog/post/2009/07/26/YAML-Brush-for-the-SyntaxHighlighter-Javascript-Library).

This plugin is remarkably simply to use. Once you've installed the SyntaxHighligher Evolved plugin, simply upload this plugin and activate it. Then you can add YAML highlighting to any code simply by wrapping it in the "yaml" shortcode.
